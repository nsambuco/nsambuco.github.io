I'm an affective and cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Bari.  
My recent research focuses on emotional processes, reward processing, decision-making, and motivation, using task-based fMRI, computational modeling, and behavioral assays.

Current interests include:
- Neural mechanisms of reward prediction and effort-based decision-making  
- Individual differences in risk-taking and sign-/goal-tracking phenotypes  
- Latent-state modeling of behavior and fMRI activity
